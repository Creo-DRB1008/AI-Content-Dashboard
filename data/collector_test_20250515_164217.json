      "text": "Ever wondered how OpenAI maintains lightning-fast product velocity while scaling exponentially?\n\nThe answer is quite counterintuitive: They don't scale teams. They multiply them.\n\nOpenAI's strategy? Deliberately keeping teams small and nimble. These focused units operate with startup-like agility, making decisions quickly and shipping innovations at a pace that would be impossible with traditional organizational structures.\nWhile most tech giants slow down as they grow, crushed under the weight of bureaucracy and approval chains.\n\nThe lesson? Sometimes the path to doing more isn't adding more people to one team\u2014it's creating more teams that can move independently.\n\nWhat do you think? Is your organization structured for velocity or comfort?\n\n#ProductDevelopment #OrganizationalStrategy #Innovation",
