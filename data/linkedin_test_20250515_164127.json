    "text": "Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) is rapidly reshaping how we search for information. From Google\u2019s AI Overviews to standalone A.I.-powered search engines, the promise is clear: instant, summarized answers to any question. But beneath the convenience lies a growing concern-A.I. search engines are fundamentally flawed, and relying on them as your primary source of truth can be risky.",

    "text": "AI and ... the courtroom?\n\n\nIn a groundbreaking instance of artificial intelligence intersecting with the legal system, \n\nthe family of Christopher Pelkey, a U.S. Army veteran tragically killed in a 2021 road-rage incident, utilized AI to bring his voice back to the courtroom. \n\nDuring the sentencing of his killer in May 2025, they presented an AI-generated video featuring a lifelike avatar of Pelkey delivering a heartfelt message. \n\nThis innovative approach aimed to convey the emotional impact of his loss in a way that traditional victim statements could not.\n\nThis case underscores the expanding boundaries of generative AI, venturing beyond conventional applications into deeply personal and emotional territories. \n\nIt prompts us to reflect on the ethical considerations and potential of AI in areas we might not have previously imagined.\n\n\nWhat's YOUR experience with AI?\nFeel free to share a comment about how it's helping (or hurting) you.\n\n\n#genai #dunDUN",

    "text": "Haris Silic has spent more than 15 years as a top recruitment executive for creative staff and executives at Artisan Talent and has had unique insight into many industry wide job market trends. \nRight now, he is warning that many of us are missing a key narrative in the employment market for creative workers. \nIt is not artificial intelligence that leaders and prospective job seekers should be fretting about, Silic says. In fact, AI is a key tool that creative workers should embrace and learn. It is actually the offshoring of talent by American creative leaders that should be of more concern, he notes. \nWhile creative leaders have been incessantly talking about the impact of artificial intelligence, Silic argues that this is \"a bit of a decoy.\" \nThere are some fascinating insights here from an executive with deep experience in the market.",
