    OpenAI has announced the release of GPT-4 Turbo, a more powerful and efficient version of their flagship language model. 
    The new model features improved reasoning capabilities, better understanding of context, and enhanced performance across 
    various tasks including coding, mathematics, and creative writing. GPT-4 Turbo also includes a larger context window 
    that can process up to 128,000 tokens, allowing for more comprehensive analysis of longer documents. The model has been 
    trained on data up to April 2024 and includes significant improvements in factual accuracy and reduced hallucinations. 
    OpenAI claims that GPT-4 Turbo is 3x faster than its predecessor while maintaining the same level of quality. The model 
    is now available through the OpenAI API with competitive pricing that makes it more accessible for developers and 
    businesses looking to integrate advanced AI capabilities into their applications.
